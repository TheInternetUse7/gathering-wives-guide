Cartethyia is an Aero main DPS who scales with HP, focused on Basic Attack DMG and [Aero Erosion] DMG.\n2. Cartethyia excels at both direct DMG and DoT, with large AoE and strong adaptability across environments.\n3. Cartethyia can apply [Aero Erosion] herself. Some of her skills are treated as [Aero Erosion] DMG, can accelerate or instantly trigger its DMG, spread its stacks, and scale her DMG based on the number of [Aero Erosion] stacks on enemies. She's a core Aero Negative Status DPS.\n4. Cartethyia has two forms: Cartethyia and Fleurdelys.", "synopsis": "1. Tip: In Cartethyia form, gather all 3 [Sword Shadows], then use a Plunging Attack to recover them and trigger buffs. Cast Resonance Liberation to transform into Fleurdelys, build up [Conviction], and unleash her enhanced Resonance Liberation.\n2. Rotation: Intro Skill (gain Blue Sword) - 4A (gain Green Sword) - E (gain Purple Sword) - Jump + AA-Q-R1-5A*2-EE-R2.\n3. Team Comp: As the core DPS in the Aero Negative Status comp, Cartethyia pairs best with Ciaccona for Support and Aero Rover for sustain. Recommended team: Cartethyia + Ciaccona + Aero Rover. Please refer to the full guide for team rotation.", "rotation": "Skill Breakdown\n1. Forte Circuit\nNormal Attack and Resonance Skill are replaced by Fleurdelys-form skills, all of which generate [Conviction], up to 120 points.\n2. Resonance Liberation\nSwitches to Fleurdelys form, consumes HP, and enters [Manifest] state. Fleurdelys's A5, 2nd hit of Mid-air Attack, and E2 instantly trigger [Aero Erosion] 1 time (consumes [Aero Erosion] stacks).\nWhen Fleurdelys is in [Manifest] state and holds different [Sword Shadows], various effects are triggered.\n● Purple Sword + [Manifest]: Increases Fleurdelys' resistance to interruption. A4 summons a force field that slows enemies within range.\n● Green Sword + [Manifest]: Reduces the interval between [Aero Erosion] trigger and increases [Aero Erosion] DMG.\n● Blue Sword + [Manifest]: After using E2 and dealing DMG, Fleurdelys' A5, 2nd hit of Mid-air Attack, and enhanced Heavy Attack will spread the highest Aero Negative Status stack from a target to all enemies within the area.\nFleurdelys generates [Conviction] upon hitting enemies.\nAt 120 [Conviction], tapping Resonance Liberation casts R2. The casting consumes all [Conviction], removes [Manifest], restores HP, and deals Aero DMG. The DMG scales with the target's Aero Negative Status stacks (up to 5 stacks) and clears the Aero Negative Status stacks afterward.\nIf under 120 [Conviction], tapping Resonance Liberation will revert back to Cartethyia form and pause the [Manifest] duration timer. While [Manifest] is active, Cartethyia's R1 has no Resonance Cost.\n3. Resonance Skill\nDeals Aero DMG (counts as Basic Attack DMG), applies 2 stacks of Aero Negative Status, and summons [Sword of Virtue's Shadow] (Purple).\n4. Normal Attack\n● Basic Attack - Cartethyia: A 4-hit combo (A1–A4). A4 applies 1 stack of Aero Negative Status and summons [Sword of Divinity's Shadow] (Green).\n● Heavy Attack - Cartethyia: Consumes STA to attack, counts as Basic Attack DMG, and summons [Sword of Discord's Shadow] (Blue).\n● Mid-air Attack - Cartethyia: Consumes STA, executes a Plunging Attack that deals Aero DMG (also treated as [Aero Erosion]). Collects all [Sword Shadows] and grants buffs based on their types.\n● Dodge Counter - Cartethyia: Triggers a Basic Attack after a successful dodge.\n5. Intro Skill\n● Cartethyia: Deals Aero DMG, applies 2 stacks of Aero Negative Status, and summons [Sword of Discord's Shadow] (Blue). This DMG is treated as [Aero Erosion] DMG.\n● Fleurdelys: Deals Aero DMG and generates [Conviction].\n6. Outro Skill\nIncreases Aero DMG dealt by allies to enemies affected by [Negative Status].\nTeam Comp Analysis:\nCartethyia is an Aero character focused on Basic Attack DMG and [Aero Erosion] DMG. She pairs best with teammates that enhance Basic Attack DMG or apply Aero Negative Status consistently.\nTeam Comp & Rotation:\nIn the following rotations: A = Basic Attack; H = Heavy Attack; E = Resonance Skill; R = Resonance Liberation; Q = Echo Skill.\n● Cartethyia + Ciaccona + Aero Rover.\nTop-tier comp in the current meta. Cartethyia increases resistance to interruption and healing, helping Aero Rover generate more Forte Gauge. Ciaccona applies off-field [Aero Erosion], amplifies [Aero Erosion] DMG and team Aero DMG. Aero Rover increases the max stacks of [Aero Erosion] on enemies. Aero Rover's signature weapon further boosts team Aero DMG.\n① Aero Rover EAA*3- Ultimate EE-QR to achieve full Concerto Energy;\n② Ciaccona enters with Intro Skill + 2A - Dodge - 4A - E - Enhanced H - R to Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n③ Cartethyia enters with Intro Skill + 4A-E- Jump AA-Q-R1-5A*2-EE-R2.\n● Cartethyia + Phoebe + Aero Rover.\nPhoebe applies [Spectro Frazzle]. Aero Rover converts it into [Aero Erosion]. Rover also increases the [Aero Erosion] stack cap, boosts team Aero DMG, and provides healing.\n① Phoebe starts with held E - QR, without achieving full Concerto Energy;\n② Aero Rover EE-EAA*3- Ultimate EE-QR and achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n③ Cartethyia enters with Intro Skill + 4A-E- Jump AA-Q-R1-5A-EE, not achieving full Conviction + R (switch to Cartethyia);\n④ Phoebe enters with 3AH*2 to fully charge Concerto Energy and leaves.\n⑤ Aero Rover enters with Intro Skill + EE, without achieving full Concerto Energy;\n⑥ Switch to Cartethyia + R-EE-R2.\n● Cartethyia + Sanhua + Aero Rover.\nBest team for beginners. Sanhua enhances Cartethyia's Basic Attack DMG, while Aero Rover increases the max stacks of [Aero Erosion] on enemies, boosts Aero DMG, and heals the team.\n① Aero Rover EAA*3- Ultimate EE-QR to achieve full Concerto Energy;\n② Sanhua enters with Intro Skill + E-R-H-A to achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n③ Cartethyia enters with Intro Skill + 4A-E- Jump AA-Q-R1-5A*2-EE-R2."}, "weapons": {"current": null, "items": [{"gbId": "21020056", "pictureUrl": "https://guide-res.aki-game.net/introduction/material/39b70b202d995d8416cbc843ceb3167f/9f0b3d873546a580e40b46abd7bd1111.png", "star": 5, "weaponType": {"gbId": "2", "pictureUrl": "https://guide-res.aki-game.net/introduction/material/d27ac36725815b69dcc8f1e9da3c5b07/fb5c81ed3a220004b71069645f112867.png", "secondPictureUrl": null, "texts": [{"language": "en", "name": "Sword"}]}, "texts": [{"language": "en", "name": "Defier's Thorn", "effectName": "A Free Knight's Tarantella", "effectDescription": "Max HP is increased by (12%/15%/18%/21%/24%).
