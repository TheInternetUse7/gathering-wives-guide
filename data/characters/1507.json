Zani is a Spectro main DPS and the core of Spectro Frazzle teams, dealing primarily Heavy Attack DMG and Spectro DMG.\n2. Zani can instantly trigger the team's [Spectro Frazzle] and convert it into her own energy, enabling a stable combat cycle.\n3. Some of Zani's skills stagnate enemies. Most of her skills offer Block/DMG Reduction, creating a safe window for sustained DPS and boosting her survivability.\n4. Zani comes with a strong [Spectro Frazzle] DMG bonus, significantly enhancing her DMG potential.", "synopsis": "1. Tip: Apply [Spectro Frazzle] via teammates to convert into [Blaze]. Build up [Redundant Energy] with Basic Attacks. Use enhanced Resonance Skill to further charge [Blaze]. Activate Resonance Liberation and chain Basic Attacks to consume Blaze, then finish with enhanced Resonance Liberation before switching out.\n2. Rotation: Intro Skill + 5A- Enhanced E-R1-3A*2-R2\n3. Team Comp: When Zani is main DPS, the most suitable sub-DPS is Phoebe. The team setup of Zani + Phoebe + Shorekeeper works well. Please refer to the full guide for team rotation.", "rotation": "Skill Breakdown\n1. Forte Circuit\nWith Zani in the team, whenever an allied unit applies [Spectro Frazzle] to an enemy, it immediately triggers DMG and converts the stacks into equal amount of [Heliacal Ember] (up to 60 stacks), enabling the set bonus from [Eternal Radiance]. At the same time, Zani gains Forte Gauge [Blaze].\nWhile in the Inferno Mode, Zani unlocks Heavy Slash skills, treated as both Heavy Attack DMG and [Spectro Frazzle] DMG. Using these skills will consume [Blaze].\n● [Blaze]: Up to 100 outside Inferno Mode. Up to 150 during Inferno Mode. Cast Targeted Action/Forcible Riposte to obtain 10 points. 5 points per stack when [Spectro Frazzle] converts into [Heliacal Ember]. 50 points upon using Resonance Liberation - Rekindle.\n● [Redundant Energy]: Max cap is 100. Gain: Hit with Basic Attack/Intro Skill/Pinpoint Strike. Cast standard Resonance Skill. Cannot gain [Redundant Energy] while in Inferno Mode.\n2. Resonance Liberation\nDeals Spectro DMG and enters Inferno Mode.\n● Inferno Mode: Basic Attack multiplier increases. When [Blaze] drops below 30 or Inferno Mode lasts for 8 seconds, the Resonance Liberation will upgrade to an enhanced version. Casting the enhanced version exits Inferno Mode.\n3. Resonance Skill\n● Standard Defense Protocol: Attack and enter block state. Afterward, press Basic Attack briefly to chain into the 3rd hit, capable of stagnating enemies. Taking DMG during the block reduces incoming DMG, stagnates nearby enemies, triggers a Pinpoint Strike.\n● Crisis Response Protocol: Available when [Redundant Energy] is full and Zani is not in Inferno Mode. Performed by holding the Resonance Skill to block. During the block, releasing the skill or when the duration ends, she will consume all [Redundant Energy] to perform Targeted Action. If attacked during the block, Zani will reduce DMG, stagnate nearby enemies, and consume all [Redundant Energy] to perform Forcible Riposte.\n4. Normal Attack\n● Basic Attack: 4-hit combo + one [Breakthrough]. A1-A2-A3-A (Breakthrough) - A4. In Inferno Mode, A3 can stagnate enemies.\n● Heavy Attack: Consumes STA to deal Spectro DMG, followed by 3rd hit of Basic Attack.\n● Mid-air Attack: Consumes STA to perform a Plunging Attack, followed by 3rd hit of Basic Attack.\n● Dodge Counter: After a successful dodge, perform a Basic Attack, followed by 3rd hit of Basic Attack.\n5. Intro Skill\nAttacks the target, dealing Spectro DMG.\n6. Outro Skill\nAttacks the target, dealing Spectro DMG. All [Heliacal Ember] stacks are cleared, and the DMG is increased based on the number of [Heliacal Ember] stacks (considered as Spectro Frazzle DMG). Teammates deal increased Spectro DMG for 20 seconds to enemies with [Heliacal Ember].\nTeam Comp Analysis: Zani can instantly trigger [Spectro Frazzle] DMG and convert stack count into her startup energy, making her the core of Spectro Negative Status comps. She pairs best with characters who can reliably apply [Spectro Frazzle].\nTeam Comp & Rotation:\nIn the following rotations: A = Basic Attack; H = Heavy Attack; E = Resonance Skill; R = Resonance Liberation; Q = Echo Skill.\n● Zani + Phoebe + Shorekeeper\nPhoebe maintains Confession mode (Support mode) at all times, efficiently stacking [Spectro Frazzle] on enemies. Her Outro Skill reduces Spectro RES. Shorekeeper boosts Crit. Rate & Crit. DMG and provides healing.\n① Shorekeeper 4AH*2-ERQ. Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n② Phoebe takes the field with Intro Skill + Held E-3AH*2-RQ. Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n③ Zani takes the field with Intro Skill + 5A - Held E -R1-3A*2-R2. Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n④ Shorekeeper enters with Intro Skill and repeats the previous rotation.\n● Zani + Phoebe + Spectro Rover\nBoth Phoebe and Spectro Rover apply [Spectro Frazzle]. Phoebe's Outro Skill reduces Spectro RES, and Spectro Rover gains additional Spectro RES reduction at S6.\n① Spectro Rover HAA-EA-RQ-HAA without achieving full Concerto Energy;\n② Phoebe Held E-3AH*2-EE-3A*2-Q. Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n③ Zani takes the field with Intro Skill + 5A - Held E -R1-3A. Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n④ Phoebe R;\n⑤ Spectro Rover EA;\n⑥ Zani 3A*2-R2. Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out.\n● Zani + Spectro Rover + Shorekeeper/Verina/Baizhi\nSpectro Rover applies [Spectro Frazzle] and gains additional Spectro RES reduction at S6, with the survival role providing healing or DMG bonus.\n① Healer quickly fully charges Concerto Energy;\n③ Spectro Rover enters with Intro Skill + EA-HAA-EA-RQ. Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n③ Zani takes the field with Intro Skill + 5A - Held E -R1-3A*2-R2. Achieve full Concerto Energy and swap out;\n④ Healer enters with Intro Skill and repeats the previous rotation.\n● Zani + Ciaccona + Shorekeeper/Verina\nCiaccona applies Spectro Frazzle from the off-field, while the sustain unit offers healing and buffs.\n① Ciaccona starts with 4A - Dodge - 4A - R - Tap yellow button without achieving full Concerto Energy;\n② Healer fully charges Concerto Energy and leaves.\n③ Zani takes the field with Intro Skill + 5A-E without achieving full Concerto Energy;\n④ Ciaccona enters with 4A-E- Enhanced H to fully charge Concerto Energy and leaves;\n⑤ Zani takes the field with Intro Skill + R1-3A*2-R2.
